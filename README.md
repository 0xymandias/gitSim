# gitSim

gitSim is a Python script that simulates GitHub contributions by generating backdated commits to a specified file. It can optionally push these commits to a remote repository, create a new branch, open a pull request, and simulate a code review by posting review comments.

This tool is useful if you want to populate a GitHub repository with activity, which might help boost your contributions graph (note that contributions are only counted if the commit email matches your GitHub account).

## Features

- Backdated Commits: Generate commits for past dates over a customizable period.
- Customizable: Control the maximum number of commits per day, commit frequency, and date range.
- Exclude Weekends: Option to skip committing on Saturdays and Sundays.
- Remote Integration: Set a remote repository URL to push changes.
- Pull Request and Code Review Simulation: Automatically create a new branch, open a pull request, and post a simulated review comment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed.
- Git installed and properly configured.
- PyGithub installed. To install, run:
  `python -m pip install PyGithub`
- A GitHub personal access token with the repo scope. Set it as an environment variable named GITHUB_TOKEN.

## Setup

1. Clone or Place the Script  
   Save the script (for example, as gitSim.py) into your desired working directory.

2. Configure Git Credentials  
   Ensure your local Git configuration uses the email address registered on your GitHub account. For example, run:
   `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
   `git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"`

3. Set Environment Variables  
   - GITHUB_TOKEN: For example, in PowerShell, run:
     `$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token_here"`
   - If using a remote repository, pass its URL via command-line arguments.

## Usage

Run the script with various command-line options to control its behavior. To display all available options, run:
   `python gitSim.py --help`

### Command-Line Options

- --repository: Remote repository URL (for example, git@github.com:user/repo.git). If provided, the script sets the remote, pushes commits, and creates a pull request.
- --max_commits: Maximum commits per day (default is 12).
- --frequency: Percentage of days on which commits will be made (default is 60).
- --no_weekends: Skip commits on Saturdays and Sundays.
- --days_before: Number of days before today to start generating commits (default is 365).
- --days_after: Number of days after today to generate commits (default is 0).
- --file: The file to update with commit changes (default is activity.txt).

## How It Works

1. Repository Initialization  
   The script checks if the current directory is a git repository and initializes one if not.

2. Simulating Commits  
   It generates backdated commits by appending lines to a specified file. The commit dates are set using the GIT_AUTHOR_DATE and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE environment variables.

3. Remote Push and Branch Creation  
   If a remote repository URL is provided:
   - The script sets the remote (if not already set) and pushes all commits.
   - It creates a new branch and pushes it to the remote.

4. Pull Request and Code Review Simulation  
   Using the GitHub API via PyGithub, the script:
   - Creates a pull request from the new branch into the base branch (default is main).
   - Simulates a code review by posting a comment on the pull request.

## Troubleshooting

- GitHub Activity Not Showing  
   Ensure your local Git configuration (user name and email) matches the one registered on GitHub. It may also take several minutes for GitHub to reindex activity.

- Credentials Issues  
   Verify your email settings by running:
   `git config --get user.email`
   And check that your GITHUB_TOKEN has the necessary permissions.

- Remote Repository Issues  
   Ensure you are using an empty repository or one that is not already initialized.
